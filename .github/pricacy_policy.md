# Privacy Policy

Nishchal Gautam ("Me", "Myself", and "I") built `Merge When Ready` (the "app") as an Open Source GitHub App. This service is provided by myself and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform users ("you") regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decided to use this service.

If you choose to use the app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The collected information is required for the service to work. It is neither stored nor shared with 3rd parties.

## Information collection and use

When installing the the app you grant it access to the following three scopes

1. **Read & write access to [pull requests] and [issues]**

   The app simply listen for events from github, checks if PR is ready to be merged.

2. **Read & write access to repository contents**

    The app when detects PR is ready to merge, it issues a merge command

The app is hosted on [Zeitâ€™s now](https://zeit.co/now). No user data is persisted besides a temporary storage of log files for less than 30 days.
